Python using the Titanic data set
---------------------------------
head, tail, shape, info, and describe are used to learn more about a pandas DataFrame. 

Panda is the library name
DataFrame is the class name

DataFrame is a class provided by the pandas library.  It is not a builtin of Python.

import pandas as pd

To use the Python Panda library  you need to add the library,  import and then load the data into the DataFrame.  

The below code works because when you load the dataset  it returns a panda DataFrame even though the panda library was not included.  If you want to use panda functions directly like pd.DataFrame  you will need to import pandas.

import seaborn as sns

titanic_df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

DataFrame is like table like structure.


What is the difference between describe , info and shape.

Shape is the number of rows and columns.

Describe is the descriptive statistics of the data frame.

info is the summary of data frame
1.) Number of rows and columns
2.) How many non null values in each column.
3.) Memory usage

Also, value_count, unique , nunique  to perform data analysis 

Null values in a count are ignored.  This leads to the summing of the values not equaling the total record count.

nunique returns a number of unique values
unique returns a list of unique values
